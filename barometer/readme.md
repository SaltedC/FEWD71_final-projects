Cognitive function is impacted in many chronic diseases, and changes in cognitive function may indicate a change in disease activity.  Stroke, Lupus, Diabetes, Traumatic Brain Injury, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia are examples of chronic diseases where changes in cognitive function can be an important marker to assess the impact of the disease on a patient's cognitive function.  The tools available now rely on qualitative, subjective, questionnaires to assess a patients perception of their cognitive function at the time of a doctors visit.  As a result, even though changes in cognitive function may be as important to quality of life as more easily measured physical changes, changes in cognitive function are often marginalized, because there is no good way to verify patient reported changes.  Additionally, the ability to track a patient's cognitive status through a non-invasive test could be a powerful tool to monitor patient status in between blood tests and physician checkups.

I feel providing patients with a quick battery of tests to be taken daily could provide a method of monitoring changes in cognitive function.  If these tests are quick, visually appealing, and fun, patients may want to take them, increasing adherence.  Examples could include a typing “race” such as provided for free at typeracer.com, and a memory matching game such as http://pulliam.github.io/color-dots/, made by made by Thais Pullman.
