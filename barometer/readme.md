Cognitive function is impacted in many chronic disease, and changes in cognitive function may indicate a change in disease activity.  Lupus, Diabetes, Traumatic Brain Injury, Depression, and Stroke are example of chronic diseases where changes in cognitive function can be an important marker o9mnt to asses the impact of the disease on a patients cognitive function, but the tools available now rely on qualitative, subjective, questionnaires.  As a result, changes in cognitive function are often marginalized, because there is no good way to verify.  However, changes in cognitive function have a huge impact on a patient’s quality of life.  Additionally, the ability to track a patients cognitive status through a non-invasive test could be a powerful tool to monitor patient status in between checkups.

I feel providing patients with a quick battery of tests to be taken daily could provide a method of monitoring changes in cognitive function.  If these tests are quick, visually appealing, and fun, patients may want to take them, increasing adherence.  Examples could include a typing “race” such as provided for free at typeracer.com, and a memory matching game such as http://pulliam.github.io/color-dots/, made by made by Thais Pullman.
