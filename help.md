Need help with:
2.Change button background color in correct order
    ** Can change backround color in given sequence
    Need to wait until button background color has reverted to original color
    to change next button in sequence
3.Capture order of buttons clicked by user
    ** Need to do this after sequence has played
    ** Currently can console the userSequence upon a click, but
    cannot access userSequence outside of getUserSequence function
